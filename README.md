# Match-Manager
A simple match manager that utilizes MLL (Multi Linked List). 

Hello nice to meet ya'll so this is me and my partner (Dimas) final data structure project. in which we utilize MLL to make a 
"Bracket Match Manager" that simulates matches with brackets but using Multi Link List. We did this project also fully in the CodeBlocks an IDE made for C/C++ 
Hence the ".cbp" file in which if people want to try with CodeBlocks they can do so, also "strukdat" is the Indonesian abbreviation for data structure.

This project implements the MLL algorithm of insert last, delete first & last, also some pointers to make the winner of the matches move on to the next.

Enjoy, Thanks

How to try : 
If you're on windows just download the "StrukDat.exe" and then run it. If you're not download the 3 cpp codes including the header and then run it
